    <strong> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</strong> [pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30
    January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political
    ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign
    for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil
    rights and freedom across the world. The honorific<strong> Mahātmā</strong>
    (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South
    Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.
